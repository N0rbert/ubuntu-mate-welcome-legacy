"Ubuntu MATE can get viruses and other infections... but it doesn't. Rapid "
"and timely updates ensure that there are very few, if any threats to Linux "
"systems like Ubuntu MATE that persist in the wild. In reality, there have "
"been very few \"public\" infections in the last 10 years that can affect "
"Ubuntu MATE. They are no longer a threat to anyone installing or using a "
"modern Linux distribution today. Ubuntu MATE is designed to make it "
"difficult for viruses, root kits and other malware to be installed and run "
"without conscious intervention by you, the user. Even if you do accidentally"
" invite in an infection, chances are it's designed to attack Windows and "
"won't do much, if any damage to Ubuntu MATE."
msgstr "Ubuntu MATE 可能会感染病毒？......不不不，它并不会。快速和及时的更新可以确保 Linux 系统——如 Ubuntu MATE 免除绝大多数威胁。实际上，在过去的10年中，很少有能影响到 Ubuntu MATE 的“公共”感染。这些病毒几乎影响不到安装使用 Linux 发行版的任何人的威胁。Ubuntu MATE的设计目标是让用户在不自行防御的情况下不感染病毒，root 工具包和其他恶意软件。即使您的电脑不小心被感染了，也只会攻击Windows，而不会在 Ubuntu MATE 上起作用。PS：放心，没人专门给 Linux 桌面用户设计病毒的啦，成本都不一定收回来。"

"For example, other operating systems look at the name of a file to determine"
" which program should open it, then immediately attempt to open it. That "
"design makes it easy for an intruder to attack a computer. Ubuntu MATE opens"
" a file based on what the file is, not based on its name. So even if a "
"malicious program disguises its identity by using the name \"Last Will and "
"Testament.txt\" Ubuntu MATE will recognize the file as a program. The system"
" provides a warning that the file is not a text file, but that it is a "
"program that will be run if you give it permission to continue. To be extra "
"secure, Ubuntu MATE requires you to provide your administrator password "
"before that permission is granted. Every single time."
msgstr "例如，其他操作系统可以查看文件的拓展名以确定哪个程序可以打开它，然后立即尝试打开它。这种设计使入侵者很容易攻击计算机。Ubuntu MATE 根据文件的实质而不是拓展名来打开文件。因此，即使恶意程序使用名称“Last Will and Testament.txt”掩盖其身份，Ubuntu MATE也会将该文件识别为程序。系统会提供一个警告，说明该文件不是文本文件，而是它是一个程序，如果您允许它继续运行，该程序将运行。为了更加安全，Ubuntu MATE 要求您在授予权限之前提供您的管理员密码。每一次使用权限都需要。"
